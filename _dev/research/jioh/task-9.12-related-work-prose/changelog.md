# Task 9.12 — Related-work and proposal prose: changelog

The slice's decision record (`research-slice-workflow.md`, Records). Scope card `scope-card.md`; stage-2 records `search/`.

## D1 — `whitelist` reproduces the name-keyed catalogue, `ananicy-rules`; Game Mode is cited for its category only (2026-10-08)

By 인지오's decision, scope-card item 21: the `whitelist` condition reproduces the name-keyed catalogue design point — a hand-maintained table from executable name to priority class, matched by name — grounded in `ananicy-rules`, with `ananicy` for the matching rule. No shipped game mode is cited as working from a list of executables, and no sentence says an operating system ships the design point.

- **The design point.** `ananicy-rules` (verified 2026-09-12 at commit `03ef03f`): a table of 15 813 entries from process name to type, 13 528 of them typed `Game`, maintained "by the CachyOS team and the community". `ananicy` (the ananicy-cpp README): `name`, the only required field, is "used for match processes by exec bin name". No source read states that a distribution enables the daemon or the catalogue by default.
- **What the game modes document** (search records S2-16 to S2-20):
  - Windows (S2-16, the four Microsoft Learn pages): "Game Mode works by default for most Windows games, requiring no action or opt-in by the customer, and no work by the game developer"; a developer may declare the `expandedResources` capability; "The app must be in the foreground and have focus before exclusive resources are granted." How a game is recognised is not stated. The Xbox Support article (S2-17) renders by script and was not read.
  - macOS (S2-18, Apple Support 105118; S2-20, the `LSSupportsGameMode` Info.plist key): "When your game enters full screen, Game Mode automatically turns on for that game"; an app declares support with a Boolean key — "If you don't include this key in your Info.plist, Game Mode might not turn on for your game." How macOS decides an app is a game is not stated in any copy read.
  - Feral GameMode (S2-19, commit `a74b810`): games "request a set of optimisations", or are launched through `gamemoderun`; its `whitelist`/`blacklist` filter is user-set and commented out in the example config. No built-in list.
- **Kept.** "Game Mode is on or off" (`docs/research-proposal.md:160`): `HasExpandedResources` reports whether the app runs "in Game Mode or shared mode" (S2-16), and Apple's is a per-game on/off (S2-18).

Hands to 9.15:

- `docs/research-proposal.md` — `:34`, `:195`, `:802` (Game Mode's "lists of known game executables", "executable list") restated without a list; the §2.1 table's rows `:148–149` restated to each vendor's documented trigger — macOS: full screen, with the app's `LSSupportsGameMode` declaration; Windows: on by default for most games, the mechanism undocumented, an optional `expandedResources` declaration, foreground and focus required; `:159`'s enumeration limit ("Game Mode works from a whitelist") attributed to the name-keyed catalogue; `:530`'s `whitelist` row "Reproduces" the name-keyed catalogue (`ananicy-rules`); `:536`'s "what shipping operating systems actually do today" restated to what a deployed, community-maintained daemon does.
- `docs/background-guide.md:18`, `:60`; `docs/research-claims.md:83`, `:132`; `docs/terminology.md:189–190`; `docs/daemon/daemon-guide.md:92`.
- The guidebook: vol-01 `:1360`, `:3376`, `:3438`, `:3719`; vol-03 `:57`, `:115`, `:1631`; vol-04 `:448`, `:492`, `:1414`, `:1797`.
- `dataset/sources.yaml`'s `gamemode-docs` note ("Existence of the category and of the whitelist design point only") restated to the category; no dataset file cites the entry, so it stays only if a dataset value derives from it (the contributor recipe, `docs/references.md:16`).

Compiled effect: none.

## D2 — related-work states Game Mode as a shipped category, Windows and macOS each from its own documentation; the name-table instance is ananicy alone (2026-10-08)

By 인지오's decision, scope-card item 16: `docs/related-work.md:40`'s sentence "Windows Game Mode reprioritizes resources when a foreground executable matches a curated list [gamemode]" leaves the name-table paragraph. Game Mode is stated in a sentence of its own as a shipped foreground-game category, Windows citing `gamemode-docs` and macOS citing Apple's documentation. The paragraph's premise sentence ("These systems validate our premise — process identity carries actionable scheduling information") rests on ananicy alone.

- **Windows** (`gamemode-docs`; S2-16, the four Microsoft Learn pages; 2026-09-13 read R07, C-gamemode-1): Game Mode grants "a game exclusive or priority access to hardware resources" — exclusive CPU sets ("Gets the expected number of exclusive CPU sets that are available to the app when in Game Mode") and "increased GPU prioritization"; "The app must be in the foreground and have focus before exclusive resources are granted." It "works by default for most Windows games, requiring no action or opt-in by the customer, and no work by the game developer"; a developer may declare the `expandedResources` capability. How a game is recognised is not stated. The deprecation note is carried with the APIs: "The Game Mode APIs are deprecated in Windows 10, version 1809 and later."
- **macOS** (S2-18, Apple Support "Use Game Mode", support.apple.com/en-us/105118, "Published Date: September 14, 2026", SHA-256 `10857702…`; S2-20, the `LSSupportsGameMode` Info.plist key, SHA-256 `a712464b…`): on a Mac with Apple silicon and macOS Sonoma 14 or later, "When your game enters full screen, Game Mode automatically turns on for that game", "giving your game the highest priority access to your CPU and GPU, lowering usage for background tasks". The `LSSupportsGameMode` key is a Boolean by which an app declares support, listed for macOS 26.0 and later — "If you don't include this key in your Info.plist, Game Mode might not turn on for your game." How macOS decides an app is a game is not stated.
- **"reprioritizes resources"** (C-gamemode-1, WORDING-FIX) restated to the two resources Microsoft names; other work is kept off the reserved cores, not throttled (`gamemode-docs`, "What the documentation does state").

Hands to 9.15:

- `docs/related-work.md:40` restated as above; `:44`'s note ("Game Mode is closed — cite Microsoft documentation but reconstruct from ananicy's design") brought in line with D1.
- `docs/references.md` — Apple's two pages entered as deployed-system entries under the id-minting rule (one entry per citable artifact), each with its URL, accessed 2026-10-07, and the copy's SHA-256 from S2-18 and S2-20; the `LSSupportsGameMode` entry's cite names the human-readable page (developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/lssupportsgamemode), the JSON being the copy read. `gamemode-docs`' cite line: its "[Exact URLs to pin.]" replaced by the four Learn URLs of S2-16.
- `docs/guidebook/vol-02-related-work.md` ch. 7.2, the same restatement.

Compiled effect: none.
